# Small-Projects
This is my python programming playground, where I test out different techniques and ideas on the lifelong road to python mastery.

Right now it isn't much, as I have just started out. But I'm aspiring to learn it all down the line. Everything from front-end to back-end, data mining,
artificial intelligence and automation. I wan't to learn it all!

You may follow along if you would like. Maybe you find some tips and tricks to add to your own projects :)
